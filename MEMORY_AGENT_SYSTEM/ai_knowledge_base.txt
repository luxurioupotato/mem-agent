Title: Artificial intelligence - Wikipedia

Artificial intelligence(AI) is the capability ofcomputational systemsto perform tasks typically associated withhuman intelligence, such aslearning,reasoning,problem-solving,perception, anddecision-making. It is afield of researchincomputer sciencethat develops and studies methods andsoftwarethat enable machines toperceive their environmentand uselearningandintelligenceto take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.1 High-profileapplications of AIinclude advancedweb search engines(e.g.,Google Search);recommendation systems(used byYouTube,Amazon, andNetflix);virtual assistants(e.g.,Google Assistant,Siri, andAlexa);autonomous vehicles(e.g.,Waymo);generativeandcreativetools (e.g.,language modelsandAI art); andsuperhumanplay and analysis instrategy games(e.g.,chessandGo). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it'snot labeled AI anymore."23 Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning,reasoning,knowledge representation,planning,natural language processing,perception, and support forrobotics.aTo reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, includingsearchandmathematical optimization,formal logic,artificial neural networks, and methods based onstatistics,operations research, andeconomics.bAI also draws uponpsychology,linguistics,philosophy,neuroscience, and other fields.4Some companies, such asOpenAI,Google DeepMindandMeta,5aim to createartificial general intelligence(AGI)AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,6and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughoutits history,78followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known asAI winters.910Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 whengraphics processing unitsstarted being used to accelerate neural networks anddeep learningoutperformed previous AI techniques.11This growth accelerated further after 2017 with thetransformer architecture.12In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapidprogressin advanced generative AI became known as theAI boom. Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, which has raisedethical concernsaboutAI's long-term effectsandpotential existential risks, prompting discussions aboutregulatory policiesto ensurethe safetyand benefits of the technology. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.a Reasoning and problem-solving Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logicaldeductions.13By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing withuncertainor incomplete information, employing concepts fromprobabilityandeconomics.14 Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a "combinatorial explosion": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow.15Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.16Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem. Knowledge representation Knowledge representationandknowledge engineering17allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,18scene interpretation,19clinical decision support,20knowledge discovery (mining "interesting" and actionable inferences from largedatabases),21and other areas.22 Aknowledge baseis a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. Anontologyis the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.23Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;24situations, events, states, and time;25causes and effects;26knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);27default reasoning(things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);28and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth ofcommonsense knowledge(the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);29and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as "facts" or "statements" that they could express verbally).16There is also the difficulty ofknowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.c Planning and decision-making An "agent" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. Arational agenthas goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.d32Inautomated planning, the agent has a specific goal.33Inautomated decision-making, the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the "utility") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the "expected utility": theutilityof all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.34 Inclassical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.35In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is "unknown" or "unobservable") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not "deterministic"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.36 In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., withinverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.37Information value theorycan be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.38The space of possible future actions and situations is typicallyintractablylarge, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. AMarkov decision processhas atransition modelthat describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. Apolicyassociates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., byiteration), beheuristic, or it can be learned.39 Game theorydescribes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.40 Machine learningis the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.41It has been a part of AI from the beginning.e There are several kinds of machine learning.Unsupervised learninganalyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.44Supervised learningrequires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties:classification(where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) andregression(where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).45 Inreinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as "good".46Transfer learningis when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.47Deep learningis a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspiredartificial neural networksfor all of these types of learning.48 Computational learning theorycan assess learners bycomputational complexity, bysample complexity(how much data is required), or by other notions ofoptimization.49 Natural language processing Natural language processing(NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages.50Specific problems includespeech recognition,speech synthesis,machine translation,information extraction,information retrievalandquestion answering.51 Early work, based onNoam Chomsky'sgenerative grammarandsemantic networks, had difficulty withword-sense disambiguationfunless restricted to small domains called "micro-worlds" (due to the common sense knowledge problem29).Margaret Mastermanbelieved that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and thatthesauriand not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP includeword embedding(representing words, typically asvectorsencoding their meaning),52transformers(a deep learning architecture using anattentionmechanism),53and others.54In 2019,generative pre-trained transformer(or "GPT") language models began to generate coherent text,5556and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on thebar exam,SATtest,GREtest, and many other real-world applications.57 Machine perceptionis the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, activelidar, sonar, radar, andtactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world.Computer visionis the ability to analyze visual input.58 The field includesspeech recognition,59image classification,60facial recognition,object recognition,61object tracking,62androbotic perception.63 Affective computingis a field that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate humanfeeling, emotion, and mood.65For example, somevirtual assistantsare programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitatehumancomputer interaction. However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents.66Moderate successes related to affective computing include textualsentiment analysisand, more recently,multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject.67 A machine withartificial general intelligencewould be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar tohuman intelligence.68 AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.b Search and optimization AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.69There are two very different kinds of search used in AI:state space searchandlocal search. State space searchsearches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.70For example,planningalgorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process calledmeans-ends analysis.71 Simple exhaustive searches72are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: thesearch space(the number of places to search) quickly grows toastronomical numbers. The result is a search that istoo slowor never completes.15"Heuristics" or "rules of thumb" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.73 Adversarial searchis used forgame-playingprograms, such as chess or Go. It searches through atreeof possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position.74 Local searchusesmathematical optimizationto find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.75 Gradient descentis a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize aloss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to trainneural networks,76through thebackpropagationalgorithm. Another type of local search isevolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by "mutating" and "recombining" them,selectingonly the fittest to survive each generation.77 Distributed search processes can coordinate viaswarm intelligencealgorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search areparticle swarm optimization(inspired by birdflocking) andant colony optimization(inspired byant trails).78 Formallogicis used forreasoningandknowledge representation.79Formal logic comes in two main forms:propositional logic(which operates on statements that are true or false and useslogical connectivessuch as "and", "or", "not" and "implies")80andpredicate logic(which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and usesquantifierssuch as "EveryXis aY" and "There aresomeXs that areYs").81 Deductive reasoningin logic is the process ofprovinga new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (thepremises).82Proofs can be structured as prooftrees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes byinference rules. Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whoseleaf nodesare labelled by premises oraxioms. In the case ofHorn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoningforwardsfrom the premises orbackwardsfrom the problem.83In the more general case of the clausal form offirst-order logic,resolutionis a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.84 Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic isundecidable, and thereforeintractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in thelogic programminglanguageProlog, isTuring complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in othersymbolic programminglanguages.85 Fuzzy logicassigns a "degree of truth" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.86 Non-monotonic logics, including logic programming withnegation as failure, are designed to handledefault reasoning.28Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning Many problems in AI (including reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods fromprobabilitytheory and economics.87Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, usingdecision theory,decision analysis,88andinformation value theory.89These tools include models such asMarkov decision processes,90dynamicdecision networks,91game theoryandmechanism design.92 Bayesian networks93are a tool that can be used forreasoning(using theBayesian inferencealgorithm),g95learning(using theexpectationmaximization algorithm),h97planning(usingdecision networks)98andperception(usingdynamic Bayesian networks).91 Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g.,hidden Markov modelsorKalman filters).91 Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., "if shiny then diamond"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., "if diamond then pick up"), on the other hand.Classifiers99are functions that usepattern matchingto determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples usingsupervised learning. Each pattern (also called an "observation") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as adata set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.45 There are many kinds of classifiers in use.100Thedecision treeis the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.101K-nearest neighboralgorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, andKernel methodssuch as thesupport vector machine(SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.102Thenaive Bayes classifieris reportedly the "most widely used learner"103at Google, due in part to its scalability.104Neural networksare also used as classifiers.105 Artificial neural networks An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known asartificial neurons, which loosely model theneuronsin a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once theweightcrosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.105 Learning algorithms for neural networks uselocal searchto choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is thebackpropagationalgorithm.106Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs andfind patternsin data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.107 Infeedforward neural networksthe signal passes in only one direction.108The termperceptrontypically refers to a single-layer neural network.109In contrast, deep learning uses many layers.110Recurrent neural networks(RNNs) feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events.Long short-term memorynetworks (LSTMs) are recurrent neural networks that better preserve longterm dependencies and are less sensitive to thevanishing gradient problem.111Convolutional neural networks(CNNs) use layers ofkernelsto more efficiently process local patterns. This local processing is especially important inimage processing, where the early CNN layers typically identify simple local patterns such as edges and curves, with subsequent layers detecting more complex patterns like textures, and eventually whole objects.112 Deep learninguses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs.110The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, inimage processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.114 Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, includingcomputer vision,speech recognition,natural language processing,image classification,115and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2021.116The sudden success of deep learning in 20122015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)ibut because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching toGPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giantcurated datasetsused for benchmark testing, such asImageNet.j Generative pre-trained transformers(GPT) arelarge language models(LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a largecorpus of textthat can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the nexttoken(a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique calledreinforcement learning from human feedback(RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called "hallucinations". These can be reduced with RLHF and quality data, but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems.124Such systems are used inchatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text.125126 Current models and services includeChatGPT,Claude,Gemini,Copilot, andMeta AI.127MultimodalGPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound, and text.128 Hardware and software In the late 2010s,graphics processing units(GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specializedTensorFlowsoftware had replaced previously usedcentral processing unit(CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic)machine learningmodels' training.129Specializedprogramming languagessuch asPrologwere used in early AI research,130butgeneral-purpose programming languageslikePythonhave become predominant.131 The transistor density inintegrated circuitshas been observed to roughly double every 18 monthsa trend known asMoore's law, named after theIntelco-founderGordon Moore, who first identified it. Improvements inGPUshave been even faster,132a trend sometimes calledHuang's law,133named afterNvidiaco-founder and CEOJensen Huang. AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including:search engines(such asGoogle Search),targeting online advertisements,recommendation systems(offered byNetflix,YouTubeorAmazon), drivinginternet traffic,targeted advertising(AdSense,Facebook),virtual assistants(such asSiriorAlexa),autonomous vehicles(includingdrones,ADASandself-driving cars),automatic language translation(Microsoft Translator,Google Translate),facial recognition(Apple'sFaceIDorMicrosoft'sDeepFaceandGoogle'sFaceNet) andimage labeling(used byFacebook, Apple'sPhotosandTikTok). The deployment of AI may be overseen by achief automation officer(CAO). The application of AI inmedicineandmedical researchhas the potential to increase patient care and quality of life.134Through the lens of theHippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.135136 For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integratingbig data. This is particularly important fororganoidandtissue engineeringdevelopment which usemicroscopyimaging as a key technique in fabrication.137It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research.137138New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example,AlphaFold 2(2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3Dstructure of a protein.139In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria.140In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search forParkinson's diseasedrug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, ofalpha-synuclein(the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.141142 Game playingprograms have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques.143Deep Bluebecame the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion,Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.144In 2011, in aJeopardy!quiz showexhibition match,IBM'squestion answering system,Watson, defeated the two greatestJeopardy!champions,Brad RutterandKen Jennings, by a significant margin.145In March 2016,AlphaGowon 4 out of 5 games ofGoin a match with Go championLee Sedol, becoming the firstcomputer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player withouthandicaps. Then, in 2017, itdefeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world.146Other programs handleimperfect-informationgames, such as thepoker-playing programPluribus.147DeepMinddeveloped increasingly generalisticreinforcement learningmodels, such as withMuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, orAtarigames.148In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level inStarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map.149In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStationGran Turismocompetition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning.150In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseenopen-worldvideo games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.151 Large language models, such asGPT-4,Gemini,Claude,LlamaorMistral, are increasingly used in mathematics. These probabilistic models are versatile, but can also produce wrong answers in the form ofhallucinations. They sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from, but also methods such assupervisedfine-tuning152or trainedclassifierswith human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections.153A February 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data.154One technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correctreasoningsteps, rather than just the correct result.155TheAlibaba Groupdeveloped a version of itsQwenmodels calledQwen2-Math, that achieved state-of-the-art performance on several mathematical benchmarks, including 84 accuracy on the MATH dataset of competition mathematics problems.156In January 2025, Microsoft proposed the techniquerStar-Maththat leveragesMonte Carlo tree searchand step-by-step reasoning, enabling a relatively small language model likeQwen-7Bto solve 53 of theAIME2024 and 90 of the MATH benchmark problems.157 Alternatively, dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such asAlphaTensor,AlphaGeometry,AlphaProofandAlphaEvolve158all fromGoogle DeepMind,159LlemmafromEleutherAI160orJulius.161 When natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such asLeanto define mathematical tasks. The experimental modelGemini Deep Thinkaccepts natural language prompts directly and achieved gold medal results in theInternational Math Olympiadof 2025.162 Some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics.163 Topological deep learningintegrates varioustopologicalapproaches. Finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated "robot advisers" have been in use for some years.164 According to Nicolas Firzli, director of theWorld Pensions  Investments Forum, it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services. He argues that "the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but I'm not sure it will unleash a new wave of e.g., sophisticated pension innovation."165 Various countries are deploying AI military applications.166The main applications enhancecommand and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability.167Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous andautonomous vehicles.166AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions,target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributedJoint Firesbetween networked combat vehicles, both human-operated andautonomous.167 AI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Israel and Ukraine.166168169170 Generative artificial intelligence(Generative AI, GenAI,171or GAI) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that usesgenerative modelsto produce text, images, videos, or other forms of data.172173174These modelslearnthe underlying patterns and structures of theirtraining dataand use them to produce new data175176based on the input, which often comes in the form of natural languageprompts.177178 Generative AI tools have become more common since theAI boomin the 2020s. This boom was made possible by improvements intransformer-baseddeepneural networks, particularlylarge language models(LLMs). Major tools includechatbotssuch asChatGPT,Copilot,Gemini,Claude,Grok, andDeepSeek;text-to-imagemodels such asStable Diffusion,Midjourney, andDALL-E; andtext-to-videomodels such asVeoandSora.179180181182183Technology companies developing generative AI includeOpenAI,xAI,Anthropic,Meta AI,Microsoft,Google,DeepSeek, andBaidu.177184185 AI agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, includingvirtual assistants,chatbots,autonomous vehicles,game-playing systems, andindustrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.196197198 Microsoft introducedCopilot Searchin February 2023 under the nameBing Chat, as a built-in feature for Microsoft Edge and Bing mobile app. Copilot Search provides AI-generated summaries199and step-by-step reasoning based of information from web publishers, ranked in Bing Search.200For safety, Copilot uses AI-based classifiers and filters to reduce potentially harmful content.201 Google officially pushed its AI Search at its Google IO event on May 20, 2025.202It keeps people looking at Google instead of clicking on a search result.AI Overviewsuses Gemini 2.5 to provide contextual answers to user queries based on web content.203 Applications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer predictions,204AI-integrated sex toys (e.g.,teledildonics),205AI-generated sexual education content,206and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g.,Replika).207AI is also used for the production of non-consensualdeepfake pornography, raising significant ethical and legal concerns.208 AI technologies have also been used to attempt to identifyonline gender-based violenceand onlinesexual groomingof minors.209210 Other industry-specific tasks There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated "AI" in some offerings or processes.211A few examples areenergy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions,foreign policy, or supply chain management. AI applications for evacuation anddisastermanagement are growing. AI has been used to investigate patterns in large-scale and small-scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Furthermore, AI can provide real-time information on the evacuation conditions.212213214 In agriculture, AI has helped farmers to increase yield and identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conductpredictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for "classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights." For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation. During the2024 Indian elections, US50 million was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creatingdeepfakesof allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages.215 AI has potential benefits and potential risks.218AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems:Demis HassabisofDeepMindhopes to "solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else".219However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified.220221In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.222 Privacy and copyright Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns aboutprivacy,surveillanceandcopyright. AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency. Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video, or audio.223For example, in order to buildspeech recognitionalgorithms,Amazonhas recorded millions of private conversations and allowedtemporary workersto listen to and transcribe some of them.224Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as anecessary evilto those for whom it is clearlyunethicaland a violation of theright to privacy.225 AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such asdata aggregation,de-identificationanddifferential privacy.226Since 2016, some privacy experts, such asCynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms offairness.Brian Christianwrote that experts have pivoted "from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'."227 Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of "fair use". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include "the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work" and "the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work".228229Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a "robots.txt" file.230In 2023, leading authors (includingJohn GrishamandJonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI.231232Another discussed approach is to envision a separatesui generissystem of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.233 Dominance by tech giants The commercial AI scene is dominated byBig Techcompanies such asAlphabet Inc.,Amazon,Apple Inc.,Meta Platforms, andMicrosoft.234235236Some of these players already own the vast majority of existingcloud infrastructureandcomputingpower fromdata centers, allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace.237238 Power needs and environmental impacts In January 2024, theInternational Energy Agency(IEA) releasedElectricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026, forecasting electric power use.239This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation.240 Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuel use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources  from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that  in the long view  AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and "intelligent", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.241 A 2024Goldman SachsResearch Paper,AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge, found "US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation...." and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8 of US power, as opposed to 3 in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.242Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.243 In 2024, theWall Street Journalreported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for US650 million.244NvidiaCEOJensen Huangsaid nuclear power is a good option for the data centers.245 In September 2024,Microsoftannounced an agreement withConstellation Energyto re-open theThree Mile Islandnuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100 of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the USNuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power  enough for 800,000 homes  of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at US1.6 billion and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 USInflation Reduction Act.246The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost US2 billion to reopen thePalisades Nuclearreactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO ofExelonwho was responsible for Exelon's spinoff of Constellation.247 After the last approval in September 2023,Taiwansuspended the approval of data centers north ofTaoyuanwith a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages.248Taiwan aims tophase out nuclear powerby 2025.248On the other hand,Singaporeimposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban.248 Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011Fukushima nuclear accident, according to an October 2024Bloombergarticle in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near a nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI.249Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI.249 On 1 November 2024, theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission(FERC) rejected an application submitted byTalen Energyfor approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power stationSusquehannato Amazon's data center.250According to the Commission ChairmanWillie L. Phillips, it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors.250 In 2025, a report prepared by the International Energy Agency estimated thegreenhouse gas emissionsfrom the energy consumption of AI at 180 million tons. By 2035, these emissions could rise to 300500 million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. This is below 1.5 of the energy sector emissions. The emissions reduction potential of AI was estimated at 5 of the energy sector emissions, butrebound effects(for example if people switch from public transport to autonomous cars) can reduce it.251 YouTube,Facebookand others userecommender systemsto guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal ofmaximizinguser engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choosemisinformation,conspiracy theories, and extremepartisancontent, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people intofilter bubbleswhere they received multiple versions of the same misinformation.252This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government.253The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem.254 In the early 2020s,generative AIbegan to create images, audio, and texts that are virtually indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, or human writing,255while realistic AI-generated videos became feasible in the mid-2020s.256257258It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda;259one such potential malicious use is deepfakes forcomputational propaganda.260AI pioneerGeoffrey Hintonexpressed concern about AI enabling "authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates" on a large scale, among other risks.261 AI researchers atMicrosoft,OpenAI, universities and other organisations have suggested using "personhood credentials" as a way to overcome online deception enabled by AI models.262 Algorithmic bias and fairness Machine learning applications will bebiasedkif they learn from biased data.264The developers may not be aware that the bias exists.265Bias can be introduced by the waytraining datais selected and by the way a model is deployed.266264If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriouslyharmpeople (as it can inmedicine,finance,recruitment,housingorpolicing) then the algorithm may causediscrimination.267The field offairnessstudies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases. On June 28, 2015,Google Photos's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as "gorillas" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,268a problem called "sample size disparity".269Google "fixed" this problem by preventing the system from labellinganythingas a "gorilla". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.270 COMPASis a commercial program widely used byU.S. courtsto assess the likelihood of adefendantbecoming arecidivist. In 2016,Julia AngwinatProPublicadiscovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61, the errors for each race were differentthe system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.271In 2017, several researcherslshowed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.273 A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as "race" or "gender"). The feature will correlate with other features (like "address", "shopping history" or "first name"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on "race" or "gender".274Moritz Hardt said "the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work."275 Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make "predictions" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions asrecommendations, some of these "recommendations" will likely be racist.276Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will bebetterthan the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.m Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4 are black and 20 are women.269 There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category isdistributive fairness, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negativestereotypesor render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict withanti-discrimination laws.263 At its 2022Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency(ACM FAccT 2022), theAssociation for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.dubiousdiscuss278 Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.279Particularly withdeep neural networks, in which there are many non-linearrelationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.280 It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with aruleras "cancerous", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.281Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at "low risk" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.282 People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation.283Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union'sGeneral Data Protection Regulationin 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.nIndustry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.284 DARPAestablished theXAI("Explainable Artificial Intelligence") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.285 Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output.286LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model.287Multitask learningprovides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.288Deconvolution,DeepDreamand othergenerativemethods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.289Forgenerative pre-trained transformers,Anthropicdeveloped a technique based ondictionary learningthat associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts.290 Bad actors and weaponized AI Artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful tobad actors, such asauthoritarian governments,terrorists,criminalsorrogue states. A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision.oWidely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentiallyweapons of mass destruction.292Even when used in conventional warfare, they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentiallykill an innocent person.292In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under theUnited Nations'Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however theUnited Statesand others disagreed.293By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.294 AI tools make it easier forauthoritarian governmentsto efficiently control their citizens in several ways.Faceandvoice recognitionallow widespreadsurveillance.Machine learning, operating this data, canclassifypotential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding.Recommendation systemscan precisely targetpropagandaandmisinformationfor maximum effect.Deepfakesandgenerative AIaid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritariancentralized decision-makingmore competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such asmarkets. It lowers the cost and difficulty ofdigital warfareandadvanced spyware.295All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlierAIfacial recognition systemsare already being used formass surveillancein China.296297 There are many other ways in which AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.298 Technological unemployment Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.299 In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that "we're in uncharted territory" with AI.300A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-termunemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit ifproductivitygains areredistributed.301Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne andCarl Benedikt Freyestimated 47 of U.S. jobs are at "high risk" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9 of U.S. jobs as "high risk".p303The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.299In April 2023, it was reported that 70 of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.304305 Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence;The Economiststated in 2015 that "the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution" is "worth taking seriously".306Jobs at extreme risk range fromparalegalsto fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.307 From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward byJoseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.308 It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicistStephen Hawkingstated, "spell the end of the human race".309This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like "self-awareness" (or "sentience" or "consciousness") and becomes a malevolent character.qThese sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. First, AI does not require human-likesentienceto be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. PhilosopherNick Bostromargued that if one givesalmost anygoal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of apaperclip maximizer).311Stuart Russellgives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that "you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead."312In order to be safe for humanity, asuperintelligencewould have to be genuinelyalignedwith humanity's morality and values so that it is "fundamentally on our side".313 Second,Yuval Noah Harariargues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things likeideologies,law,government,moneyand theeconomyare built onlanguage; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence ofmisinformationsuggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.314 The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI.315Personalities such asStephen Hawking,Bill Gates, andElon Musk,316as well as AI pioneers such asYoshua Bengio,Stuart Russell,Demis Hassabis, andSam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI. In May 2023,Geoffrey Hintonannounced his resignation from Google in order to be able to "freely speak out about the risks of AI" without "considering how this impacts Google".317He notably mentioned risks of anAI takeover,318and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI.319 In 2023, many leading AI experts endorsedthe joint statementthat "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war".320 Some other researchers were more optimistic. AI pioneerJürgen Schmidhuberdid not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95 of all cases, AI research is about making "human lives longer and healthier and easier."321While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, "they can also be used against the bad actors."322323Andrew Ngalso argued that "it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AIand that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests."324Yann LeCun"scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction."325In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.326However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.327 Ethical machines and alignment Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans.Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.328 Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.329The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,329and was founded at anAAAIsymposium in 2005.330 Other approaches includeWendell Wallach's "artificial moral agents"331andStuart J. Russell'sthree principlesfor developing provably beneficial machines.332 Active organizations in the AI open-source community includeHugging Face,333Google,334EleutherAIandMeta.335Various AI models, such asLlama 2,MistralorStable Diffusion, have been made open-weight,336337meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the "weights") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freelyfine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case.338Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitatebioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.339 Artificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design, development, and implementation of an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework, developed by theAlan Turing Instituteand based on the SUM values, outlines four main ethical dimensions, defined as follows:340341 Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during theAsilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others;342however, these principles are not without criticism, especially regarding the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks.343 Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.344 TheUK AI Safety Institutereleased in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under an MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities.345 The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.346The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.347According to AI Index atStanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone.348349Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.350Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.350TheGlobal Partnership on Artificial Intelligencewas launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.350Henry Kissinger,Eric Schmidt, andDaniel Huttenlocherpublished a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.351In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years.352In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, government officials and academics.353On 1 August 2024, the EUArtificial Intelligence Actentered into force, establishing the first comprehensive EU-wide AI regulation.354In 2024, theCouncil of Europecreated the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the "Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories.355 In a 2022Ipsossurvey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78 of Chinese citizens, but only 35 of Americans, agreed that "products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks".348A 2023ReutersIpsos poll found that 61 of Americans agree, and 22 disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity.356In a 2023Fox Newspoll, 35 of Americans thought it "very important", and an additional 41 thought it "somewhat important", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13 responding "not very important" and 8 responding "not at all important".357358 In November 2023, the first globalAI Safety Summitwas held inBletchley Parkin the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.35928 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence.360361In May 2024 at theAI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI.362363 The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly toAlan Turing'stheory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning.365366This, along with concurrent discoveries incybernetics,information theoryandneurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an "electronic brain".rThey developed several areas of research that would become part of AI,368such asMcCullochandPittsdesign for "artificial neurons" in 1943,117and Turing's influential 1950 paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced theTuring testand showed that "machine intelligence" was plausible.369366 The field of AI research was founded ata workshopatDartmouth Collegein 1956.s6The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.tThey and their students produced programs that the press described as "astonishing":ucomputers were learningcheckersstrategies, solving word problems in algebra, provinglogical theoremsand speaking English.v7Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.366 Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine withgeneral intelligenceand considered this the goal of their field.373In 1965Herbert Simonpredicted, "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do".374In 1967Marvin Minskyagreed, writing that "within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved".375They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.wIn 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to thecriticismofSir James Lighthill377and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress tofund more productive projects.378MinskyandPapert's bookPerceptronswas understood as proving thatartificial neural networkswould never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.379The "AI winter", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.9 In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success ofexpert systems,380a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan'sfifth generation computerproject inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding foracademic research.8However, beginning with the collapse of theLisp Machinemarket in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.10 Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-levelsymbolsto representmental objectslike plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especiallyperception,robotics,learningandpattern recognition,381and began to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches.382Rodney Brooksrejected "representation" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.xJudea Pearl,Lotfi Zadeh, and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic.87387But the most important development was the revival of "connectionism", including neural network research, byGeoffrey Hintonand others.388In 1990,Yann LeCunsuccessfully showed thatconvolutional neural networkscan recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.389 AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This "narrow" and "formal" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such asstatistics,economicsandmathematics).390By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as "artificial intelligence" (a tendency known as theAI effect).391However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield ofartificial general intelligence(or "AGI"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.68 Deep learningbegan to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.11For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.yDeep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers,393graphics processing units,cloud computing394) and access tolarge amounts of data395(including curated datasets,394such asImageNet). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.zThe amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50 in the years 20152019.350 In 2016, issues offairnessand the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. Thealignment problembecame a serious field of academic study.327 In the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015,AlphaGo, developed byDeepMind, beat the world championGo player. The program taught only the game's rules and developed a strategy by itself.GPT-3is alarge language modelthat was released in 2020 byOpenAIand is capable of generating high-quality human-like text.396ChatGPT, launched on November 30, 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months.397It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness.398These programs, and others, inspired an aggressiveAI boom, where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about US50 billion annually was invested in "AI" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20 of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in "AI".399About 800,000 "AI"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022.400According to PitchBook research, 22 of newly fundedstartupsin 2024 claimed to be AI companies.401 Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines.402Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications.403Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such asepistemologyandfree will.404Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy andethics of AI.403 Defining artificial intelligence Alan Turingwrote in 1950 "I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?"405He advised changing the question from whether a machine "thinks", to "whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour".405He devised theTuring test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.369Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is "actually" thinking or literally has a "mind". Turing notes thatwe can not determine these things about other peoplebut "it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks."406 RussellandNorvigagree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure.1However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. "Aeronautical engineeringtexts", they wrote, "do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly likepigeonsthat they can fool other pigeons.'"408AI founderJohn McCarthyagreed, writing that "Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence".409 McCarthy defines intelligence as "the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world".410Another AI founder,Marvin Minsky, similarly describes it as "the ability to solve hard problems".411The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.1These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the "intelligence" of the machineand no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible. Another definition has been adopted by Google,412a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. As a result of the many circulating definitions scholars have started to critically analyze and order the AI discourse itself413including discussing the many AI narratives and myths to be found within societal, political and academic discourses.414Similarly, in practice, some authors have suggested that the term 'AI' is often used too broadly and vaguely. This raises the question of where the line should be drawn between AI and classical algorithms,415with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketingbuzzword, often even if they did "not actually use AI in a material way".416 There has been debate over whetherlarge language modelsexhibit genuine intelligence or merely simulate it byimitating human text.417 Evaluating approaches to AI No established unifying theory orparadigmhas guided AI research for most of its history.aaThe unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term "artificial intelligence" to mean "machine learning with neural networks"). This approach is mostlysub-symbolic,softandnarrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers. Symbolic AI and its limits Symbolic AI(or "GOFAI")419simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at "intelligent" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed thephysical symbol systems hypothesis: "A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action."420 However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object orcommonsense reasoning.Moravec's paradoxis the discovery that high-level "intelligent" tasks were easy for AI, but low level "instinctive" tasks were extremely difficult.421PhilosopherHubert Dreyfushadarguedsince the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a "feel" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.422Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.ab16 The issue is not resolved:sub-symbolicreasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such asalgorithmic bias. Critics such asNoam Chomskyargue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,424425in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away fromexplainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field ofneuro-symbolic artificial intelligenceattempts to bridge the two approaches. "Neats" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such aslogic,optimization, orneural networks). "Scruffies" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,426but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both. Soft vs. hard computing Finding a provably correct or optimal solution isintractablefor many important problems.15Soft computing is a set of techniques, includinggenetic algorithms,fuzzy logicand neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. Narrow vs. general AI AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence andsuperintelligencedirectly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals.427428General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively. Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind There is no settled consensus inphilosophy of mindon whether a machine can have amind,consciousnessandmental statesin the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence.RussellandNorvigadd that "the additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on."429However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue inartificial intelligence in fiction. David Chalmersidentified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the "hard" and "easy" problems of consciousness.430The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how thisfeelsor why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While humaninformation processingis easy to explain, humansubjective experienceis difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person toknow what red looks like.431 Computationalism and functionalism Computationalism is the position in thephilosophy of mindthat the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to themindbody problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophersJerry FodorandHilary Putnam.432 PhilosopherJohn Searlecharacterized this position as "strong AI": "The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds."acSearle challenges this claim with hisChinese roomargument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind.436 AI welfare and rights It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advancedAI is sentient(has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree.437But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals.438439Sapience(a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment orself-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights.438Robot rightsare also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.440 In 2017, the European Union considered granting "electronic personhood" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.441Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance ofhuman rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part in society on their own.442443 Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be amoral blind spotanalogous toslaveryorfactory farming, which could lead tolarge-scale sufferingif sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.439438 Superintelligence and the singularity Asuperintelligenceis a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.428If research intoartificial general intelligenceproduced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able toreprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to whatI. J. Goodcalled an "intelligence explosion" andVernor Vingecalled a "singularity".444 However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow anS-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.445 Robot designerHans Moravec, cyberneticistKevin Warwickand inventorRay Kurzweilhave predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future intocyborgsthat are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings ofAldous HuxleyandRobert Ettinger.446 Edward Fredkinargues that "artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution", an idea first proposed bySamuel Butler's "Darwin among the Machines" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon byGeorge Dysonin his 1998 bookDarwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence.447 Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,448and have been a persistent theme inscience fiction.449 A commontropein these works began withMary Shelley'sFrankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works asArthur C. Clarke'sandStanley Kubrick's2001: A Space Odyssey(both 1968), withHAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of theDiscovery Onespaceship, as well asThe Terminator(1984) andThe Matrix(1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort fromThe Day the Earth Stood Still(1951) and Bishop fromAliens(1986) are less prominent in popular culture.450 Isaac Asimovintroduced theThree Laws of Roboticsin many stories, most notably with the "Multivac" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;451while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.452 Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that havethe ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears inKarel Čapek'sR.U.R., the filmsA.I. Artificial IntelligenceandEx Machina, as well as the novelDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, byPhilip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.453 The two most widely used textbooks in 2023 (see theOpen Syllabus): The four most widely used AI textbooks in 2008:

Title: Machine learning - Wikipedia

Machine learning(ML) is afield of studyinartificial intelligenceconcerned with the development and study ofstatistical algorithmsthat can learn fromdataandgeneraliseto unseen data, and thus performtaskswithout explicitinstructions.1Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field ofdeep learninghave allowedneural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.2 ML finds application in many fields, includingnatural language processing,computer vision,speech recognition,email filtering,agriculture, andmedicine. The application of ML to business problems is known aspredictive analytics. Statisticsandmathematical optimisation(mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning.Data miningis a related field of study, focusing onexploratory data analysis(EDA) viaunsupervised learning.45 From a theoretical viewpoint,probably approximately correct learningprovides a framework for describing machine learning. The termmachine learningwas coined in 1959 byArthur Samuel, anIBMemployee and pioneer in the field ofcomputer gamingandartificial intelligence.67The synonymself-teaching computerswas also used in this time period.89 The earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s whenArthur Samuelinvented acomputer programthat calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes.10In 1949,CanadianpsychologistDonald Hebbpublished the bookThe Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced atheoretical neural structureformed by certain interactions amongnerve cells.11Hebb's modelofneuronsinteracting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, orartificial neuronsused by computers to communicate data.10Other researchers who have studied humancognitive systemscontributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logicianWalter PittsandWarren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up withalgorithmsthat mirror human thought processes.10 By the early 1960s, an experimental "learning machine" withpunched tapememory, called Cybertron, had been developed byRaytheon Companyto analysesonarsignals,electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentaryreinforcement learning. It was repetitively "trained" by a human operatorteacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a "goof" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions.12A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.13Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.14In 1981, a report was given on using teaching strategies so that anartificial neural networklearns to recognise 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.15 Tom M. Mitchellprovided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: "A computer program is said to learn from experienceEwith respect to some class of tasksTand performance measurePif its performance at tasks inT, as measured byP, improves with experienceE."16This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentallyoperational definitionrather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This followsAlan Turing's proposal in his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence", in which the question "Can machines think?" is replaced with the question "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?".17 Modern day Machine Learning algorithms are broken into 3 algorithms types: Supervised Learning Algorithms, Unsupervised Learning Algorithms, and Reinforcement Learning Algorithms.18 Relationships to other fields Artificial intelligence As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest forartificial intelligence(AI). In the early days of AI as anacademic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed "neural networks"; these were mostlyperceptronsandother modelsthat were later found to be reinventions of thegeneralised linear modelsof statistics.20Probabilistic reasoningwas also employed, especially inautomated medical diagnosis.21: 488 However, an increasing emphasis on thelogical, knowledge-based approachcaused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.21: 488By 1980,expert systemshad come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favour.22Work on symbolicknowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading toinductive logic programming(ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, inpattern recognitionandinformation retrieval.21: 708710, 755Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI andcomputer sciencearound the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AICS field, as "connectionism", by researchers from other disciplines includingJohn Hopfield,David Rumelhart, andGeoffrey Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention ofbackpropagation.21: 25 Machine learning (ML), reorganised and recognised as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from thesymbolic approachesit had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics,fuzzy logic, andprobability theory.22 There is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts theposterior probabilitiesof a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by usingarithmetic codingon the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for "general intelligence".232425 An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicitfeature space vectors, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space ℵ, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm x. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM.26 According toAIXItheory, a connection more directly explained inHutter Prize, the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form. Examples of AI-powered audiovideo compression software includeNVIDIA Maxine, AIVC.27Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression includeOpenCV,TensorFlow,MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression.28 Inunsupervised machine learning,k-means clusteringcan be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such asimage compression.29 Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by thecentroidof its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial inimageandsignal processing, k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space.30 Machine learning anddata miningoften employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based onknownproperties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on thediscoveryof (previously)unknownproperties in the data (this is the analysis step ofknowledge discoveryin databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as "unsupervised learning" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals,ECML PKDDbeing a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability toreproduce knownknowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previouslyunknownknowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. Machine learning also has intimate ties tooptimisation: Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of someloss functionon a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign alabelto instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples).33 Characterizing the generalisation of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially fordeep learningalgorithms. Machine learning andstatisticsare closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws populationinferencesfrom asample, while machine learning finds generalisable predictive patterns.34 Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be.35 Leo Breimandistinguished two statistical modelling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model,36wherein "algorithmic model" means more or less the machine learning algorithms likeRandom Forest. Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they callstatistical learning.37 Analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyse the weight space ofdeep neural networks.38Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area ofmedical diagnostics.39 A core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience.340Generalisation in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examplestasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch oftheoretical computer scienceknown ascomputational learning theoryvia theprobably approximately correct learningmodel. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. Thebiasvariance decompositionis one way to quantify generalisationerror. For the best performance in the context of generalisation, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject tooverfittingand generalisation will be poorer.41 In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done inpolynomial time. There are two kinds oftime complexityresults: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the "signal" or "feedback" available to the learning system: Although each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all problems.424344 Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.45The data, known astraining data, consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by anarrayor vector, sometimes called afeature vector, and the training data is represented by amatrix. Throughiterative optimisationof anobjective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.46An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.16 Types of supervised-learning algorithms includeactive learning,classificationandregression.47Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, while regression algorithms are used when the outputs can take any numerical value within a range. For example, in a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input is an incoming email, and the output is the folder in which to file the email. In contrast, regression is used for tasks such as predicting a person's height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data.48 Similarity learningis an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications inranking,recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification. Unsupervised learning Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labelled, classified or categorised. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering,dimensionality reduction,5anddensity estimation.49 Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (calledclusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by somesimilarity metricand evaluated, for example, byinternal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, andseparation, the difference between clusters. Other methods are based onestimated densityandgraph connectivity. A special type of unsupervised learning called,self-supervised learninginvolves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself.5051 Semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning falls betweenunsupervised learning(without any labelled training data) andsupervised learning(with completely labelled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabelled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labelled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy. Inweakly supervised learning, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.52 Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with howsoftware agentsought to takeactionsin an environment so as to maximise some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such asgame theory,control theory,operations research,information theory,simulation-based optimisation,multi-agent systems,swarm intelligence,statisticsandgenetic algorithms. In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as aMarkov decision process(MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms usedynamic programmingtechniques.53Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent. Dimensionality reduction Dimensionality reductionis a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.54In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of thefeatureset, also called the "number of features". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination orextraction. One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction isprincipal component analysis(PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D). Themanifold hypothesisproposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensionalmanifolds, and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area ofmanifold learningandmanifold regularisation. Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. For example,topic modelling,meta-learning.55 Self-learning, as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, namedcrossbar adaptive array(CAA).5657It gives a solution to the problem learning without any external reward, by introducing emotion as an internal reward. Emotion is used as state evaluation of a self-learning agent. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.58The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W w(a,s) such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behaviour) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioural environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioural environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behaviour, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.59 Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training.60Classic examples includeprincipal component analysisand cluster analysis. Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manualfeature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task. Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labelled input data. Examples includeartificial neural networks,multilayer perceptrons, and superviseddictionary learning. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabelled input data. Examples include dictionary learning,independent component analysis,autoencoders,matrix factorisation61and various forms ofclustering.626364 Manifold learningalgorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional.Sparse codingalgorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros.Multilinear subspace learningalgorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly fromtensorrepresentations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors.65Deep learningalgorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.66 Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms. Sparse dictionary learning Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination ofbasis functionsand assumed to be asparse matrix. The method isstrongly NP-hardand difficult to solve approximately.67A popularheuristicmethod for sparse dictionary learning is thek-SVDalgorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied inimage de-noising. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.68 Indata mining, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.69Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such asbank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to asoutliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.70 In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.71 Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.72Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabelled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as "normal" and "abnormal" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behaviour from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model. Robot learningis inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning,7374and finallymeta-learning(e.g. MAML). Association rule learning is arule-based machine learningmethod for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of "interestingness".75 Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves "rules" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilisation of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.76Rule-based machine learning approaches includelearning classifier systems, association rule learning, andartificial immune systems. Based on the concept of strong rules,Rakesh Agrawal,Tomasz Imielińskiand Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded bypoint-of-sale(POS) systems in supermarkets.77For example, the ruleonions,potatoesburgerdisplaystyle mathrm onions,potatoes Rightarrow mathrm burger found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotionalpricingorproduct placements. In addition tomarket basket analysis, association rules are employed today in application areas includingWeb usage mining,intrusion detection,continuous production, andbioinformatics. In contrast withsequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions. Learning classifier systems(LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically agenetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing eithersupervised learning,reinforcement learning, orunsupervised learning. They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in apiecewisemanner in order to make predictions.78 Inductive logic programming(ILP) is an approach to rule learning usinglogic programmingas a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program thatentailsall positive and no negative examples.Inductive programmingis a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such asfunctional programs. Inductive logic programming is particularly useful inbioinformaticsandnatural language processing.Gordon PlotkinandEhud Shapirolaid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting.798081Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples.82The terminductivehere refers tophilosophicalinduction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather thanmathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set. Amachine learning modelis a type ofmathematical modelthat, once "trained" on a given dataset, can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data. During training, a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model's internal parameters to minimise errors in its predictions.83By extension, the term "model" can refer to several levels of specificity, from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned.84 Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems, picking the best model for a task is calledmodel selection. Artificial neural networks Artificial neural networks (ANNs), orconnectionistsystems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by thebiological neural networksthat constitute animalbrains. Such systems "learn" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules. An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called "artificial neurons", which loosely model theneuronsin a biological brain. Each connection, like thesynapsesin a biological brain, can transmit information, a "signal", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is areal number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called "edges". Artificial neurons and edges typically have aweightthat adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that ahuman brainwould. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations frombiology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, includingcomputer vision,speech recognition,machine translation,social networkfiltering,playing board and video gamesandmedical diagnosis. Deep learningconsists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.85 Decision tree learning uses adecision treeas apredictive modelto go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures,leavesrepresent class labels, and branches representconjunctionsof features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typicallyreal numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions anddecision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision-making. Random forest regression Random forest regression (RFR) falls under umbrella of decisiontree-based models. RFR is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and to avoid overfitting. To build decision trees, RFR uses bootstrapped sampling, for instance each decision tree is trained on random data from the training set. This random selection of RFR for training enables model to reduce bias predictions and achieve a higher degree of accuracy. RFR generates independent decision trees, and it can work on single output data as well multiple regressor tasks. This makes RFR compatible to be used in various applications.8687 Support-vector machines Support-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of relatedsupervised learningmethods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category.88An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic,binary,linear classifier, although methods such asPlatt scalingexist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called thekernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form islinear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such asordinary least squares. The latter is often extended byregularisationmethods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as inridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models includepolynomial regression(for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel89),logistic regression(often used instatistical classification) or evenkernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of thekernel trickto implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space. Multivariate linear regressionextends the concept of linear regression to handle multiple dependent variables simultaneously. This approach estimates the relationships between a set of input variables and several output variables by fitting amultidimensionallinear model. It is particularly useful in scenarios where outputs are interdependent or share underlying patterns, such as predicting multiple economic indicators or reconstructing images,90which are inherently multi-dimensional. A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilisticgraphical modelthat represents a set ofrandom variablesand theirconditional independencewith adirected acyclic graph(DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that performinferenceand learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, likespeech signalsorprotein sequences, are calleddynamic Bayesian networks. Generalisations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are calledinfluence diagrams. A Gaussian process is astochastic processin which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has amultivariate normal distribution, and it relies on a pre-definedcovariance function, or kernel, that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations. Given a set of observed points, or inputoutput examples, the distribution of the (unobserved) output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new, unobserved point. Gaussian processes are popular surrogate models inBayesian optimisationused to dohyperparameter optimisation. A genetic algorithm (GA) is asearch algorithmandheuristictechnique that mimics the process ofnatural selection, using methods such asmutationandcrossoverto generate newgenotypesin the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.9293Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic andevolutionary algorithms.94 The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or DempsterShafer theory, is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such asprobability,possibilityandimprecise probability theories. These theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined (e.g., Dempster's rule of combination), just like how in apmf-based Bayesian approach would combine probabilities.95However, there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance anduncertainty quantification. These belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of variousensemble methodsto better handle the learner'sdecision boundary, low samples, and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving.967However, the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions (classes), and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches. Rule-based machine learning (RBML) is a branch of machine learning that automatically discovers and learns 'rules' from data. It provides interpretable models, making it useful for decision-making in fields like healthcare, fraud detection, and cybersecurity. Key RBML techniques includeslearning classifier systems,97association rule learning,98artificial immune systems,99and other similar models. These methods extract patterns from data and evolve rules over time. Typically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions. When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representativesampleof data. Data from the training set can be as varied as acorpus of text, a collection of images,sensordata, and data collected from individual users of a service.Overfittingis something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes, thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives.Algorithmic biasis a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training. Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably, becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams. Federated learning is an adapted form ofdistributed artificial intelligenceto training machine learning models that decentralises the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralised server. This also increases efficiency by decentralising the training process to many devices. For example,Gboarduses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back toGoogle.100 There are many applications for machine learning, including: In 2006, the media-services providerNetflixheld the first "Netflix Prize" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10. A joint team made up of researchers fromATT Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built anensemble modelto win the Grand Prize in 2009 for 1 million.104Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realised that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns ("everything is a recommendation") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.105In 2010, an article inThe Wall Street Journalnoted the use of machine learning by Rebellion Research to predict the2008 financial crisis.106In 2012, co-founder ofSun Microsystems,Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80 of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.107In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognised influences among artists.108In 2019Springer Naturepublished the first research book created using machine learning.109In 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID-19.110Machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro-environmental behaviour of travellers.111Recently, machine learning technology was also applied to optimise smartphone's performance and thermal behaviour based on the user's interaction with the phone.112113114When applied correctly, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can utilise a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns withoutoverfitting. By employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts, MLAs can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques likeOLS.115 Recent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry, where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions, thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes.116 Machine Learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters. Different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes.117118119Other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires.120121 Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.122123124Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.125 The "black box theory" poses another yet significant challenge. Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque, meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data.126The House of Lords Select Committee, which claimed that such an "intelligence system" that could have a "substantial impact on an individual's life" would not be considered acceptable unless it provided "a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions" it makes.126 In 2018, a self-driving car fromUberfailed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.127Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with theIBM Watsonsystem failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.128129Microsoft'sBing Chatchatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users.130 Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature. While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves.131 Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI.132It contrasts with the "black box" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision.133By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation. Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalising the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.134 Other limitations and vulnerabilities Learners can also disappoint by "learning the wrong lesson". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.135A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgements from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in "adversarial" images that the system misclassifies.136137 Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. For some systems, it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel.138Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation or evasion viaadversarial machine learning.139 Researchers have demonstrated howbackdoorscan be placed undetectably into classifying (e.g., for categories "spam" and well-visible "not spam" of posts) machine learning models that are often developed or trained by third parties. Parties can change the classification of any input, including in cases for which a type ofdatasoftware transparencyis provided, possibly includingwhite-box access.140141142 Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like theholdoutmethod, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 23 training set and 13 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validationmethod randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods,bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.143 In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently reportsensitivity and specificitymeaning true positive rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report thefalse positive rate(FPR) as well as thefalse negative rate(FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators.Receiver operating characteristic(ROC) along with the accompanying Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) offer additional tools for classification model assessment. Higher AUC is associated with a better performing model.144 Theethicsofartificial intelligencecovers a broad range of topics within AI that are considered to have particular ethical stakes.145This includesalgorithmic biases,fairness,146automated decision-making,147accountability,privacy, andregulation. It also covers various emerging or potential future challenges such asmachine ethics(how to make machines that behave ethically),lethal autonomous weapon systems,arms racedynamics,AI safetyandalignment,technological unemployment, AI-enabledmisinformation,148how to treat certain AI systems if they have amoral status(AI welfare and rights),artificial superintelligenceandexistential risks.145 Different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on human-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.149 Systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitising cultural prejudices.150For example, in 1988, the UK'sCommission for Racial Equalityfound thatSt. George's Medical Schoolhad been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have non-European sounding names.149Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants.151152Another example includes predictive policing companyGeolitica's predictive algorithm that resulted in "disproportionately high levels of over-policing in low-income and minority communities" after being trained with historical crime data.153 While responsiblecollection of dataand documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning, some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of AI for machine learning's vulnerability to biases.154In fact, according to research carried out by the Computing Research Association (CRA) in 2021, "female faculty merely make up 16.1" of all faculty members who focus on AI among several universities around the world.155Furthermore, among the group of "new U.S. resident AI PhD graduates," 45 identified as white, 22.4 as Asian, 3.2 as Hispanic, and 2.4 as African American, which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of AI.155 Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.156157Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on languagecorporawill necessarily also learn these biases.158159In 2016, Microsoft testedTay, achatbotthat learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.160 In an experiment carried out byProPublica, aninvestigative journalismorganisation, a machine learning algorithm's insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged "black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants".153In 2015, Google Photos once tagged a couple of black people as gorillas, which caused controversy. The gorilla label was subsequently removed, and in 2023, it still cannot recognise gorillas.161Similar issues with recognising non-white people have been found in many other systems.162 Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.163Concern forfairnessin machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good, is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, includingFei-Fei Li, who said that "there's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired by people, it's created by people, andmost importantlyit impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility."164 There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated.165 Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for trainingdeep neural networks(a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units.166By 2019, graphics processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.167OpenAIestimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects fromAlexNet(2012) toAlphaZero(2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.168169 Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)are specialised hardware accelerators developed byGooglespecifically for machine learning workloads. Unlike general-purposeGPUsandFPGAs, TPUs are optimised for tensor computations, making them particularly efficient for deep learning tasks such as training and inference. They are widely used in Google Cloud AI services and large-scale machine learning models like Google's DeepMind AlphaFold and large language models. TPUs leverage matrix multiplication units and high-bandwidth memory to accelerate computations while maintaining energy efficiency.170Since their introduction in 2016, TPUs have become a key component of AI infrastructure, especially in cloud-based environments. Neuromorphic computing Neuromorphic computingrefers to a class of computing systems designed to emulate the structure and functionality of biological neural networks. These systems may be implemented through software-based simulations on conventional hardware or through specialised hardware architectures.171 Physical neural networks Aphysical neural networkis a specific type of neuromorphic hardware that relies on electrically adjustable materials, such as memristors, to emulate the function ofneural synapses. The term "physical neural network" highlights the use of physical hardware for computation, as opposed to software-based implementations. It broadly refers to artificial neural networks that use materials with adjustable resistance to replicate neural synapses.172173 Embedded machine learning Embedded machine learning is a sub-field of machine learning where models are deployed onembedded systemswith limited computing resources, such aswearable computers,edge devicesandmicrocontrollers.174175176177Running models directly on these devices eliminates the need to transfer and store data on cloud servers for further processing, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches, privacy leaks and theft of intellectual property, personal data and business secrets. Embedded machine learning can be achieved through various techniques, such ashardware acceleration,178179approximate computing,180and model optimisation.181182Common optimisation techniques includepruning,quantization,knowledge distillation, low-rank factorisation, network architecture search, and parameter sharing.

Title: Natural language processing - Wikipedia

Natural language processing(NLP) is the processing ofnatural languageinformation by acomputer. The study of NLP, a subfield ofcomputer science, is generally associated withartificial intelligence. NLP is related toinformation retrieval,knowledge representation,computational linguistics, and more broadly withlinguistics.1 Major processing tasks in an NLP system include:speech recognition,text classification,natural language understanding, andnatural language generation. Natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s.2Already in 1950,Alan Turingpublished an article titled "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" which proposed what is now called theTuring testas a criterion of intelligence, though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence. The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language. Symbolic NLP (1950s  early 1990s) The premise of symbolic NLP is well-summarized byJohn Searle'sChinese roomexperiment: Given a collection of rules (e.g., a Chinese phrasebook, with questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural language understanding (or other NLP tasks) by applying those rules to the data it confronts. Statistical NLP (1990spresent) Up until the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction ofmachine learningalgorithms for language processing. This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (seeMoore's law) and the gradual lessening of the dominance ofChomskyantheories of linguistics (e.g.transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort ofcorpus linguisticsthat underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.9 Approaches: Symbolic, statistical, neural networks Symbolic approach, i.e., the hand-coding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols, coupled with a dictionary lookup, was historically the first approach used both by AI in general and by NLP in particular:1920such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules forstemming. Machine learningapproaches, which include both statistical and neural networks, on the other hand, have many advantages over the symbolic approach: Rule-based systems are commonly used: In the late 1980s and mid-1990s, the statistical approach ended a period ofAI winter, which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rule-based approaches.2122 The earliestdecision trees, producing systems of hardifthen rules, were still very similar to the old rule-based approaches. Only the introduction of hiddenMarkov models, applied to part-of-speech tagging, announced the end of the old rule-based approach. A major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaboratefeature engineering. Since 2015,23the statistical approach has been replaced by theneural networksapproach, usingsemantic networks24andword embeddingsto capture semantic properties of words. Intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing) are not needed anymore. Neural machine translation, based on then-newly inventedsequence-to-sequencetransformations, made obsolete the intermediate steps, such as word alignment, previously necessary forstatistical machine translation. The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing. Some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks. Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they can be subdivided into categories for convenience. A coarse division is given below. Text and speech processing Morphological analysis Lexical semantics (of individual words in context) Relational semantics (semantics of individual sentences) Discourse (semantics beyond individual sentences) Higher-level NLP applications General tendencies and (possible) future directions Based on long-standing trends in the field, it is possible to extrapolate future directions of NLP. As of 2020, three trends among the topics of the long-standing series of CoNLL Shared Tasks can be observed:47 Most higher-level NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language. More broadly speaking, the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP (see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above). Cognitionrefers to "the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses."48Cognitive scienceis the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes.49Cognitive linguisticsis an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics, combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics.50Especially during the age ofsymbolic NLP, the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies. As an example,George Lakoffoffers a methodology to build natural language processing (NLP) algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science, along with the findings of cognitive linguistics,51with two defining aspects: Ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of NLP, but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s. Nevertheless, approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks, e.g., of cognitive grammar,54functional grammar,55construction grammar,56computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience (e.g.,ACT-R), however, with limited uptake in mainstream NLP (as measured by presence on major conferences57of theACL). More recently, ideas of cognitive NLP have been revived as an approach to achieveexplainability, e.g., under the notion of "cognitive AI".58Likewise, ideas of cognitive NLP are inherent to neural modelsmultimodalNLP (although rarely made explicit)59and developments inartificial intelligence, specifically tools and technologies usinglarge language modelapproaches60and new directions inartificial general intelligencebased on thefree energy principle61by British neuroscientist and theoretician at University College LondonKarl J.
