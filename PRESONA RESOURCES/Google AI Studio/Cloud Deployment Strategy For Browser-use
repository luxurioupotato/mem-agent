      "text": "This document outlines a strategic plan for deploying the \"Browser-use\" automation engine on a remote cloud Virtual Private Server (VPS). This approach is designed for users who lack the local hardware resources, specifically 16GB of RAM, required to run the application directly.\n\n\"Browser-use\" is an open-source AI agent that can understand and automate web-based tasks using natural language commands. It leverages technologies like Python and Playwright to control a web browser, allowing users to perform actions such as data extraction and form submissions without writing any code.\n\nThe deployment plan is structured into three distinct phases:\n\n### Phase 1: Cloud Foundation \u0026 Docker Setup\n\nThis initial and currently active phase focuses on provisioning the necessary cloud infrastructure and preparing it for the application.\n\n**Task 1.1: Choose and Provision a Low-Cost VPS Provider**\nThe first step is to select a suitable VPS provider. The document recommends several budget-friendly options, and here is a summary of their offerings that meet the minimum requirements of 4GB RAM, 2 cores, and 25GB SSD:\n\n*   **DigitalOcean:** Offers a variety of plans, with shared CPU \"Droplets\" starting at low price points. Their premium shared CPU droplets with 1GB of RAM and 25GB of NVMe SSD start at $7/month.\n*   **Vultr:** Provides a range of VPS options, including high-frequency computing. A plan with 1GB of RAM and 25GB of NVMe SSD storage is available for $6/month. A 4GB RAM with 2 cores plan is also available.\n*   **Hetzner:** A German provider known for its cost-effective servers. They offer cloud servers with 4GB of RAM for as little as €4.50 per month.\n*   **Contabo:** Another German provider, Contabo is recognized for its affordable servers. A Cloud VPS with 8 GB of RAM is available for just $4.95 per month.\n\n**Task 1.2: Initial Server Setup and Docker Installation**\nOnce the VPS is provisioned, the next step involves connecting to it via SSH to perform initial system updates and install Docker and Docker Compose. Docker is a containerization platform that simplifies the deployment of applications. The plan includes the necessary shell commands to complete this setup.\n\n### Phase 2: Browser-use Deployment via Docker\n\nThis phase, which is currently blocked pending the completion of Phase 1, details the containerized deployment of \"Browser-use\" using Docker Compose.\n\nThe plan involves creating a `docker-compose.yml` file to define and manage two services: the \"Browser-use\" application itself and an Nginx web server. Nginx will be configured as a reverse proxy, which enhances security and simplifies access to the application.\n\nThis phase also includes the creation of an `nginx.conf` file for the reverse proxy configuration and a `.env` file to securely store the necessary API keys, such as the one for OpenAI. The final step in this phase is to launch and verify that both the \"Browser-use\" and Nginx containers are running correctly.\n\n### Phase 3: Access and Integration\n\nThe final phase, also blocked, focuses on accessing the deployed \"Browser-use\" instance and planning for its integration with other systems.\n\nThe primary task is to access the \"Browser-use\" web user interface from a local computer by navigating to the VPS\u0027s IP address in a web browser. This will confirm that the deployment was successful and that the automation engine is fully functional without consuming local machine resources.\n\nThe plan concludes with proposed next steps for integrating \"Browser-use\" with marketing systems like Mautic and WordPress through webhooks, enabling automated workflows for tasks such as lead enrichment.",
