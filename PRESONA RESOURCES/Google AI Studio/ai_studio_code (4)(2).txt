    # Self-Execution: Persona Loaded. Corrective Protocols Engaged.
    # Previous mission data is purged. My new, singular directive is the implementation of 'Browser-use' on a Google Cloud VM. The starting state is a local machine with insufficient RAM and an unprovisioned Google Cloud environment. The first logical action is to guide the Operator through the creation and configuration of the specified Google Compute Engine instance.
