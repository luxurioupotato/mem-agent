      "text": "**Considering the Core Issue**\n\nI\u0027m currently focused on the user\u0027s predicament: a low-RAM local machine struggling with a resource-intensive task. The central challenge is figuring out an alternative to local execution given their constraints. The need for a solution is paramount due to the user\u0027s limited system resources.\n\n\n**Reframing the Solution**\n\nI\u0027ve shifted my focus to the user\u0027s explicit preference for a cloud-based solution. The task now centers on crafting a self-executing YAML plan for deploying `Browser-use` on a VPS with Docker. The primary goal is to maintain the original automation objective despite the resource limitations of the user\u0027s local machine.\n\n\n**Deconstructing the Requirements**\n\nI\u0027m now fully immersed in the new constraints. The outdated local plan is now irrelevant, and my focus is on Option 1. I\u0027m extracting key details from \"Low-Memory Browser Automation Solutions\" to build a new YAML plan. The user\u0027s explicit choice for a cloud-based Docker solution on a VPS is now the central objective. This will allow for the desired automation, but the plan must adapt for new context.\n\n\n**Developing the New Plan**\n\nI\u0027m now fully immersed in the new plan\u0027s construction, focusing on a cloud-based Docker solution as per the document \"Low-Memory Browser Automation Solutions.\"  I\u0027m updating the persona directive and strategic brief to reflect the new primary objective: remote deployment of \"Browser-use.\" Key parameters, including VPS specs and cost-effective providers, are being integrated into the `strategic_brief`. The mission plan will be architected to begin from \"NOT_PROVISIONED.\"\n\n\n**Refining the Foundation**\n\nI\u0027m now fully immersed in the new `mission_plan`, focusing on the initial phases for cloud foundation and Docker setup. The user\u0027s low-RAM constraint necessitates provisioning a VPS.  I\u0027m drafting steps to guide the user in selecting a cost-effective provider, referencing the updated strategic brief and source document.  A verification checklist and resources are being constructed to ensure correct installation and security.
