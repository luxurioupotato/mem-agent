The initial focus is on verifying file permissions and the presence of `info.php`. I\u0027m starting by checking if the user actually has access to the `/var/www/pixelcartelh-q.com/info.php` file, which is crucial for the webserver. The `ls -l` command\u0027s results should illuminate this.\n\n\n**Fixing Directory Permissions**\n\nI\u0027ve determined that the root cause of the 404 error is not the `info.php` file itself, but likely insufficient directory permissions. Examining the `ls -l` output, I see the file has read permissions for others, including the `www-data` user Nginx runs as. However, since the directories are owned by root, `www-data` might not have execute permissions, preventing it from traversing the directory structure to access `info.php`.\n\n\n**Confirming Ownership Change**\n\nI\u0027m now fully focused on confirming the ownership change. It seems the most elegant fix is changing ownership recursively of the web root to `www-data:www-data`. I\u0027ll confirm with the user that this action will ensure Nginx can traverse the directory structure and access `info.php`. Finally, I\u0027ll instruct the user to re-check that the error is resolved.\n\n\n**Confirming the Ownership Change**\n\nI\u0027ve determined that the `www-data` user, essential for Nginx, lacks access to the parent directories of `info.php`. My next step is to communicate a focused resolution. The `sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/pixelcartelhq.com` command will recursively change the ownership, providing the required access to `info.php`. I will confirm this is executed, then request confirmation that the error is resolved.\n\n\n",
