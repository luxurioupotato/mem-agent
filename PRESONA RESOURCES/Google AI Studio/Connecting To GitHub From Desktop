This involves cloning a copy of the repository to your computer and pushing changes back up to GitHub. Here are the tools you can use:\n\n*   **GitHub Desktop**: A visual client that allows you to manage your repositories with a graphical interface, eliminating the need to memorize Git commands.\n*   **Git and GitHub CLI**: For those who prefer the command line, you can use Git to manage your repositories and the GitHub CLI to interact with GitHub for tasks like creating pull requests and forking repositories.\n*   **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**: Many code editors like Visual Studio Code have built-in support for Git and GitHub, allowing you to work in one place.\n\n### Authentication\n\nTo connect to a GitHub repository from your computer, you will need to authenticate using either HTTPS or SSH:\n\n*   **HTTPS**: This is the recommended method.
