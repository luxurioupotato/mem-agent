API_BASE_URL = "https://saturday-distant-motors-clone.trycloudflare.com"
```

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Dashboard Shows Errors:**
1. **Check API URL**: Ensure it's exactly `https://saturday-distant-motors-clone.trycloudflare.com`
2. **Wait for Restart**: Give the app 2-3 minutes to fully restart
3. **Check Logs**: Look at Streamlit Cloud logs for any errors
4. **Test API Directly**: Visit the API URL in your browser to confirm it's working
