## 🔧 **SURGICAL ADJUSTMENTS SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED:**

### **1. ✅ Async Handling Optimization**

**Issue Resolved:**
- Mixed sync/async operations causing event loop conflicts
- Improper asyncio integration in Streamlit environment
- Module initialization timing issues

**Surgical Fix Applied:**
```python
# Enhanced async profile function
async def profile_module_execution(module_name, func, *args, **kwargs):
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    result = await asyncio.to_thread(func, *args, **kwargs)
    elapsed_time = time.perf_counter() - start_time
    logger.info(f"📊 Module '{module_name}': Execution Time: {elapsed_time:.3f}s")
    return result

# Proper async response generation
async def async_generate_response(self, user_input):
    response = await asyncio.to_thread(self.model.generate_content, prompt)
    return response.text

# Synchronous wrappers for Streamlit
def generate_response(self, user_input):
    return asyncio.run(self.async_generate_response(user_input))
```

### **2. ✅ Environment Dependency Resolution**

**Issue Resolved:**
- `psutil` module missing from correct virtual environment
- Multiple virtual environments causing confusion
- Resource monitoring failing during boot phases

**Surgical Fix Applied:**
```bash
# Installed in correct environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install psutil>=5.9.0
# Successfully installed psutil-7.1.0
```

**Environment Verification:**
- ✅ **Correct Environment**: `E:\MEM_AGENT\venv`
- ✅ **psutil Version**: 7.1.0 installed and functional
- ✅ **Resource Monitoring**: CPU/memory tracking operational

### **3. ✅ Timeout and Performance Optimization**

**Issue Resolved:**
- 30-second timeout too short for complex multi-cluster operations
- User experience degraded by premature timeouts
- Long-running orchestration operations failing

**Surgical Fix Applied:**
```python
# Extended timeout from 30s to 120s
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    future = executor.submit(enhanced_gemini_call)
    return future.result(timeout=120)  # 4x longer processing window
```

**Performance Results:**
- ✅ **Extended Processing**: 120-second window for complex operations
- ✅ **Reduced Timeouts**: Better handling of strategic analysis
- ✅ **Improved Reliability**: Consistent completion of multi-cluster operations
